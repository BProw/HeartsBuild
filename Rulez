GAMEPLAY RULES

4 players to start game
deal cards clockwise, starting with player to right of 'dealer' for that hand (dealer position also rotates clockwise from hand to hand)
play for each round starts with 2 clubs
player left of 2 clubs next
all players must play card of suit that was led for that trick
player with highest card in suit led takes that trick and all points that come with it
player who takes trick, leads next trick
hearts cannot be led until broken unless void in all other suits
hearts and/ or QS can be 'broken' first trick if void in clubs
each heart accounts for one point (2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H, 7H, 8H, 9H, 10H, JH, QH, KH, AH) and the Q of Spades is 13 points totaling 26 points per round
each round involves 13 cards player per player, so 13 tricks per round
each player passes two cards at the beginning of each round - 2 cards to left 1st round, 2 cards to right 2nd round, 2 cards across 3rd round, then HOLD/ no pass 4th round, repeat
if player in lead only has cards that everybody else is void of, fast forward all remaining tricks and points to that player to save time
if a player takes all tricks containing the 26 points for that round, player 'shoots the moon' and adds 26 points to all three other players at table and takes 0 for him/herself
player who shoots the moon may subtract 26 points from his/ her score (player's decision) if adding would end the game and make player who shot the moon lose
^ let me know if that rule needs clarification ^
players may also 'shoot the sun' by taking all 13 tricks and all 26 points in round - this is 52 points to all other three players
game ends when any player breaks 50 points, player with lowest score when that player breaks 50 points is declared the winner
winner gets $1 / point from other three players when game ends - player who breaks 50 only owes $1/ point for different from winner's score to 50 (not for instance, from 56 pts)
